# Postman-API-Testing
A simple API project for experimenting with JWT-based authentication. It includes endpoints for user registration, login, and token validation. The system supports role-based access (User/Admin) and simulates token expiry. Postman is used to test requests, verify access control, and observe API responses under different scenarios.
